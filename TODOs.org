* TODO simple evaluators per builtin-ops.
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>

* DONE ~__eq__~ methods for some literal-nodes?
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>

* TODO storing function defs?
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>
    1) in binding?
    2) as an object-tree?

* TODO a stack needs for ~funcall~?
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>

* TODO mapped-vars and mapped-funcs.
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>


* TODO Arrange packages (nodes, builtin-ops, evaluators)
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>

* TODO JSON Ser/DeSer?
  - <2016-12-27 Tue>
    - https://github.com/antidot/Pyckson
      - (I guess) Jackson-clone.
      - Seems nice fit to PoC's objective. (because, it will rewritten
        in Java later).

* TODO ~Comments~ on everywhere?
  - <2016-12-27 Tue> Every node should be able to have a comment.

* TODO the /evaluator/.
  - <2016-12-27 Tue>
    - or just use term /interpreter/.
      - because using same term evaluator for a node and nodes is
        confusing.

* TODO const?
  - <2016-12-27 Tue>
    1. should ~Binding~ support this?
    2. ..or just implement this with its evaluator?

* TODO let-bindings?
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>
    1. support upvar, global, const?
    2. depend each binding, DAC-graph.
    3. ..is it should be in primitives? or just implement with
       mapped-func?


* TODO Update the README.
  - <2016-12-28 Wed>
    1) Separate contents by sections.

* DONE remove doctest.
  - <2016-12-28 Wed> just use doctests as docstrings.


* DONE pytest for elpy-test-runner.
